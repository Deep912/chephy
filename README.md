# 🥗 **Chephy** 🍳

### Your Fridge-to-Feast Recipe Generator 🚀

Welcome to **Chephy**, the app that turns your random fridge leftovers into culinary masterpieces! 🎉 Got a sad carrot, half an onion, and some questionable cheese? No problem! Just toss those ingredients into the app, and voilà—dinner is served! 🍽️

This is my ReactJS learning project, so be gentle. I’m using some AI magic (aka an API) to generate recipes because, let’s be honest, I can barely boil water. 💁‍♂️

---

## 🚀 **How It Works**

1. **Open the App**: Pray it doesn’t crash. 🙏
2. **Enter Your Ingredients**: Type in whatever’s lurking in your fridge. (Yes, even that weird jar of pickles from 2019.)
3. **Hit "Cook!"**: The AI will whip up a recipe faster than you can say "Gordon Ramsay."
4. **Cook (or Order Takeout)**: Follow the recipe or just admire it. No judgment here.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend**: ReactJS (because I’m trying to adult and learn something useful)
- **Backend**: AI API (because I’m not smart enough to come up with recipes on my own)
- **Styling**: CSS (or as I like to call it, "Why won’t this div center?!")
- **Humor**: 100% organic, free-range dad jokes

## 🤔 **FAQs**

**Q: What if I only have ketchup and a single tortilla?**  
A: The AI will probably suggest you order pizza. 🍕

**Q: Can I use this app to impress my crush?**  
A: Sure, but no guarantees. If it backfires, just blame the AI. 🤖

**Q: Why is the code so messy?**  
A: Because I’m learning, okay? Cut me some slack. 😅
